In medical image analysis, images must first be preprocessed. This process is very important in terms of the accuracy of the results to be obtained from the analysis. Noise removal, thresholding, blurring, resizing and histogram equalization are the basic image preprocessing methods.

If we do not have enough data, a small number of data can be reproduced by diversifying by using the method known as data duplication method. This diversification includes operations such as rotating the image, mirroring, changing the color channel, and cropping.
